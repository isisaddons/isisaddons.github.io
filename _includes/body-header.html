            <p>Each add-on is hosted in its own github repo:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>isis-module-xxx</code> : a domain object &quot;module&quot; that implements business logic for a
                    particular subdomain, eg application settings, or tags (labels).</li>
                </li>
                <li><code>isis-wicket-yyy</code> : a component for Isis' Wicket viewer, eg for rendering calendars or maps.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>READMEs</h3>
            <p>
                Each add-on has its own <code>README</code>; use that to learn more about the features provided by the add-on and how to
                install/configure the add-on.  Some add-ons also have wiki pages (linked from the <code>README</code>).
            </p>

            <h3>Forking the Repos</h3>
            <p>
                All repos follow a standard structure, including a demo webapp and tests, to make them easy to fork and extend.
            </p>

            <h3>Other Add-ons</h3>
            <p>
                There are also a number of other add-ons that either do not fit into the above categories, or which do not follow
                the above package requirements, but which may nevertheless be of interest to developers building apps with
                Apache Isis.  The repos for these additional add-ons have been forked into this site for convenience.
            </p>
