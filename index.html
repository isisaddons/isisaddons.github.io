<h3>About this site</h3>

<p>
    This site catalogs a number of add-ons to <a href="http://isis.apache.org"></a> Apache Isis for you to use
    either "out of the box", or as a starting point to modify and adapt
    to your own requirements.
</p>

<p>Each add-on is hosted in its own github repo, named as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>isis-module-xxx</code> : a domain object &quot;module&quot; that implements business logic for a
        particular subdomain, eg application settings, or tags (labels)
    </li>
    <li><code>isis-wicket-yyy</code> : an extension to Isis' Wicket viewer, eg for rendering calendars or maps</li>
    <li><code>isis-facets-zzz</code> : an extension to Isis' metamodel, eg new annotations or programming conventions.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Some add-ons also provide a companion <code>-example</code> repo. These allow you to quickly
    try out the add-on to see if it fits your requirements.
</p>

<h3>Domain Modules</h3>
<p>
    In the case of the <code>isis-module-xxx</code> addons, these typically have the following structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>dom</code> - domain object module</li>
    <li><code>fixture</code> - fixtures</li>
    <li><code>integtests</code> - integration tests</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Only the <code>dom</code> module is released into <a href="http://search.maven.org">Maven central repo</a>; this is
    all that
    is required if you have no need to customize the functionality.
</p>

<p>
    If you do need to modify/adapt the provided functionality, then fork the entire repo; this
    way you also have fixtures and integration tests to ensure that your changes are properly tested.
    And, if you think others would benefit from your changes, please consider raising a pull request
    to fold those changes back into the original.
</p>


<h3>READMEs</h3>
<p>
    Each add-on has its own <code>README</code>; use that to learn more about the features provided by the add-on and how to
    install/configure the add-on.
