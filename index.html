<p>
    This site catalogs a number of add-ons to <a href="http://isis.apache.org">Apache Isis</a> for you to use
    either "out of the box", or as a starting point to modify and adapt
    to your own requirements.  All add-ons live in the <code>org.isisaddons</code> package.
</p>

<p>Each add-on is hosted in its own github repo, named as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>isis-module-xxx</code> : a domain object &quot;module&quot; that implements business logic for a
        particular subdomain, eg application settings, or tags (labels).</li>
    </li>
    <li><code>isis-wicket-yyy</code> : an extension to Isis' Wicket viewer, eg for rendering calendars or maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are also a number of other add-ons that either do not fit into the above categories, or which do not follow
    the above package requirements, but which may nevertheless be of interest to developers building apps with
    Apache Isis.  The repos for these additional add-ons have been forked into this site for convenience.
</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>
    All repos follow a standard structure.  In the case of the <code>isis-module-xxx</code> add-ons, these have the 
    following structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>dom</code> - domain object module (released) </li>
    <li><code>fixture</code> - fixtures</li>
    <li><code>integtests</code> - integration tests</li>
    <li><code>webapp</code> - webapp to run</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the case of the <code>isis-wicket-xxx</code> add-ons, the structure is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>lib</code> - library module (released) </li>
    <li><code>fixture</code> - fixtures</li>
    <li><code>webapp</code> - webapp to run, and webapp (UI) tests</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Only the <code>dom</code> (for module add-ons) or <code>lib</code> (for wicket add-ons)is released into 
    <a href="http://search.maven.org">Maven central repo</a>; this is all that is required if you have no need to customize the functionality.
</p>

<p>
    If you do need to modify/adapt the provided functionality, then fork the entire repo; this
    way you also have fixtures and tests to ensure that your changes are properly tested.
    And, if you think others would benefit from your changes, please consider raising a pull request
    to fold those changes back into the original.
</p>


<h3>READMEs</h3>
<p>
    Each add-on has its own <code>README</code>; use that to learn more about the features provided by the add-on and how to
    install/configure the add-on.  Some add-ons also have wiki pages (linked from the <code>README</code>).
