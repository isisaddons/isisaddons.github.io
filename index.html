<h3>About this site</h3>

<p>
This site catalogs a number of add-ons to Apache Isis for you to use
either "out of the box", or for you to use a starting point to modify and adapt
to your own requirements.
</p>

<p>Each add-ons is hosted in its own github repo, named as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <code>isis-module-xxx</code> : a domain object `module` which is provides business logic for a particular subdomain </li>
    <li> <code>isis-wicket-yyy</code> : an extension to Isis' wicket viewer, eg for rendering calendars or maps </li>
    <li> <code>isis-facets-zzz</code> : an extension to Isis' metamodel, eg new annotations or programming conventions. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some add-ons provide a companion <code>-example</code> repo.  These allow you to quickly
try out the add-on to see if it fits your requirements.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the <code>isis-module-xxx</code> addons, these typically have the following structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>dom</code> - domain object module </li>
    <li><code>fixture</code> - fixtures </li>
    <li><code>integtests</code> - integration tests </li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the <code>dom</code> module is released into  <a href="http://search.maven.org">Maven central repo</a>; this is all that
is required if you have no need to customize the functionality.
</p>

<p>
If you do need to modify/adapt the provided functionality, then fork the entire repo; this
way you also have fixtures and integration tests to ensure that your changes are properly tested.
And, if you think others would benefit from your changes, please consider raising a pull request
to fold those changes back into the original.
</p>
